# ONAP-UI React Components

This project aims to create a unified UI styled components for multiple development teams who work on the same web-based applications. 
This repository contains the definition of all the basic components implemented in React.

In order to use the accompanied styles, you would need to also install onap-ui-common.

### Usage

#### React Code examples
###### Importing particular component
```js
import Button from 'onap-ui-react/lib/react/Button.js';

// inside component rendering...
render(){
	return (
		<Button>I am a Button</Button>
	);
}
```
###### Importing particular component from the react library
```js
import {Button} from 'onap-ui-react/lib/react';

// inside component rendering...
render(){
	return (
		<Button>I am a Button</Button>
	);
}
```
###### Importing the entire library
```js
import ONAPUIReact from 'onap-ui-react';

// inside component rendering...
render(){
	return (
		<ONAPUIReact.Button>I am still a Button</ONAPUIReact.Button>
	);
}
```
### Running storybook
The components in this library are displayed via [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook). Head to [http://onap-sdc.github.io/onap-ui-react](http://onap-sdc.github.io/onap-ui-react) to see the components that are in `master`.

While developing, just run `npm run storybook` in your terminal to launch a local storybook server where you can see your changes. For deploying storybook to your own fork repository, refer to the guides section below.
